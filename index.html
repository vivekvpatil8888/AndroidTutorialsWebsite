                    <p>Android Studio is google's official IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for Android Developers.</p>
                    <p>Android Studio’s job is to provide the interface for you to create your apps and to handle much of the
                        complicated file-management behind the scenes. The programming language you will be using is Java
                        and this is installed separately on your machine. Android Studio is simply where you will write,
                        edit and save your projects and the files that comprise said projects.</p>
                    <p>Now we are ready to create our first Android Project. Follow the below steps:</p>
                    <p>1. Go to ‘File’ -> ‘New Project...’ </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/newproj.png">
                    <p>2. Give Application Name as ‘Hello World’ and click ‘Next’</p>

                    <p>3. Select ‘Phone and Tablets’ and click next.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/newproj3.png">
                    <p>4. Select ‘Next’ -> select ‘Empty Activity’ -> Select ‘Next’ -> ‘Finish’</p>

                    <b>Part 2: Android IDE Overview</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>After you create new project you should see screen as follows.</p>
                    <p>You can’t see other windows ? By default only editor window will be shown where other windows will be
                        in minimized form. The following image shows all the windows in expanded form. Android Studio offers
                        different tools and window for various purposes.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/window1.png">
                    <p>Now you should be able to see a New Window with two tabs open named ‘activity_main.xml’ and ‘MainActivity.java’
                        in editor window.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>1 - Editor Window</b>
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/window2.png">
                    <p>The
                        <b>editor window</b> is where you create and modify code. By default editor window shows two files which
                        are layout file (activity_main.xml) and java file (MainActivity.java) . Depending on the current
                        file type, the editor can change. For example, when viewing a layout file, the editor displays the
                        Layout Editor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>2 - Project Window</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>To open project Window, click on project tab located on the left of editor window. Refer following image.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/window3.png">
                    <p>Now you should be able to see the project window as follows.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/window4.png">
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/window5.png">
                    <p>When you start a new project, Android Studio creates the necessary structure for all your files and makes
                        them visible in the Project window on the left side of the IDE (click View > Tool Windows > Project).
                        This window provides an overview of the key components inside your project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are different views/scopes in project window. By default, Android Studio displays your project files in the Android
                        view. This view does not reflect the actual file hierarchy on disk, but is organized by modules and
                        file types to simplify navigation between key source files of your project, hiding certain files
                        or directories that are not commonly used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To see the actual file structure of the project including all files hidden from the Android view, select Project from the
                        dropdown at the top of the Project window. When you select Project view, you can see a lot more files
                        and directories.
                    </p>

                        <b>3 - Gradle Window</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Click on the tab named ‘Gradle’ present at the upper right section of the IDE. Refer the attached image.</p>

                    <p>Gradle Window shows gradle files.</p>
                    <p>In Android Studio, Gradle is a custom build tool used to build android packages (apk files) by managing
                        dependencies and providing custom build logic. An apk file gets signed and pushed to the device using
                        ADB(Android Debug Bridge) where it gets executed. Apk file can be used to install the application
                        in any android device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note : One should not attempt to edit the gradle files. These are auto-generated files by Android Studio which is more than
                        sufficient to build your project. Gradle file manipulation is done at high levels which is out of
                        the scope of this course.

                    <p>To open Structure Window, just click on the Structure tab present below Project tab. After that you should
                        see following image. You can open most of the windows, just be clicking on their tabs and close the
                        windows by clicking opened windows again.

                        The structured window shows list of methods in your java classes. You can sort them alphabetically or according to their
                        access modifiers using buttons present at upper left corner in the window.

                    <p>The build variance window lets you manage your build process. By default you are using something called
                        the debug variant. But there’s also the release variant which you will use when your application
                        is ready for release.

                    <b>Part 4: Version Control System</b>
                    <p>Github is a website for storing your project’s files.</p>
                    <p>It is powered by Git, which, in its turn, is a version control system, a software to help you manage
                        files in a versioned, distributed fashion and is optimized towards software source code files.
                    </p>
                    <p>It allows you to collaborate with other developers, review any changes they make and file or follow up
                        with issues on the project’s files or resulting software’s behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since Github is one of the Git repository hosting services which is most widely used, Android Studio
                        provides inbuilt Github integration. We will now upload our Hello World project to Github.
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Go to ‘File’ - > ‘Settings’ -> ‘Version Control’ -> ‘GitHub’.</p>

                    <p>2. Since You don’t have a GitHub account, you will click on Sign Up hyperlink.

                    <p>4. Fill the details appropriately and click on ‘Create an Account’.

                    <img src="images/tutorial1/version3.png">
                    <p>5. From this page select ‘Unlimited public repositories for free’.</p>

                        can be accessed by anyone where as ‘Private Repository’ can only be accessed by the user and authorized
                        members. This difference is mainly for the security purpose.

                    <p>Now that we’ve understood what repositories are, let's learn how to commit changes to a repository. First,
                        go back to Android Studio.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/commit1.png">
                    <p>1. Let’s make a change first. Open ‘activity_main.xml’ in Design Mode.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Double click on ‘Hello World’ text. Now you should see an ‘Attributes’ Window on the right side of
                        IDE.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Change the text to ‘Hello First Commit’ by typing in the box next to ‘text’ in ‘TextView’ and press
                        enter.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/commit2.png">
                    <p>Remember, this change won’t be automatically added in Github repository. The changes are saved in your
                        local machine only. Committing in Github means saving all the changes you made in files at a particular
                        time. To commit a change we need to first ‘add’ the file to ‘Staging Area’</p>
                    <p>4. Right click on ‘Hello World’ and click on ‘Add’ as shown in the image. You can also use the keyboard
                        shortcut. Now your change is ready for commit.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/commit3.png">
                    <p>5. Go to ‘Version Control’ tab -> ‘Local Changes’ tab.
                    </p>
                    <p>6. Click on the ‘Commit’ button as shown in the image.

                    <img src="images/tutorial1/commit4.png">
                    <p>7. The first section in ‘Commit Changes’ pop-up window shows the files in which you have made changes.
                        You can select which files changes to get committed. By default all the files with changes will be
                        selected.
                    </p>
                    <p>8. You can add a commit message which is useful to describe what was the commit about in simple words.</p>
                    <p>9. In “Diff” section you can see the difference between the same file’s state before and after you made
                        the change. It is used to review your change before you finally commit it.</p>
                    <p>10. Click on ‘Commit’.</p>
                    <p>11. If you get following message just click on ‘Commit’ ignoring the warning. Since it is a very simple
                        change, the warning won’t affect the functionality of the application and code.</p>

                        <b>Branching in GitHub: </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Whatever changes you made till now were done in ‘Master’ Branch i.e. main branch of the development.
                        To check this fact, you can look at bottom right of your screen which shows text ‘Git:master’. This
                        tells you that you are currently working in master branch.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial1/commit8.png">
                    <p>Github offers a feature called ‘branching’ with which we can create branches other than master branch.
                        This usually done when you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without
                        messing with that main line. </p>
                    <p>Consider a tree for example. A tree always has some branches along with the large trunk. Similarly, branches
                        in Git are smaller parts of the project which need not interfere with the main branch (recall master).
                        They have their own commits and are added to master once they are completed. The master branch is
                        like the trunk of a tree. In most cases, the code contained in the master branch is usually the one
                        being deployed. So Let’s Create a Branch.
                    </p>
                    <p>1. click on Git:master -> plus 'New Branch'
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Give name 'SubBranch' to your new branch and click ok. </p>
                    <p>Note: Observe the checkbox 'Checkout branch'. 'Checkout' in github means 'switching' to a particular
                        branch. In this case this checkbox is checked which means that upon creating your new branch you
                        will switch to this new branch.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. See the pop-up msg at the bottom of the IDE on Version Control tab. Also notice at right bottom that
                        your branch is changed to 'Git:SubBranch'. See the image.
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Let's make a change in this branch. Change the text to 'Hello SubBranch !' in layout.
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Now commit the change with the message 'Hello SubBranch'. Refer Images.

                        need to push the commits to the remote repository.

                    <p>We created branches with the hope that someday they would help the tree grow into its final form.</p>
                    <p>Merging combines the changes from both branches to form one cohesive branch. It also combines all the
                        commits from the branches. The branch being merged isn't deleted, it's still available and you can
                        keep working on it even after you've merged it.</p>
                    <p>Let’s merge our branches ‘master’ and ‘SubBranch’.
                    </p>
                    <p>1. First you need to checkout(Switch) to the master branch for merging. Click on ‘Git:SubBranch’ -> master(Local
