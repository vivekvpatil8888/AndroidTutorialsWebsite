                    </p>
                    <p>An Android layout is a class that handles arranging the way its elements appear on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are some standard layouts in android which are widely used explained as follows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>1. Linear Layout:</b> LinearLayout is a view group that aligns all children in a single direction,
                        vertically or horizontally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>2. Relative Layout</b> RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions.
                        The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of
                        or below another view) or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned
                        to the bottom, left or center).
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial3/img12.png">
                    <p>
                        <b>3. Grid Layout:</b> GridLayout uses a grid of infinitely-thin lines to separate its drawing area
                        into: rows, columns, and cells. It supports both row and column spanning, this means it is possible
                        to merge adjacent cells into a large cell (a rectangle) to contain a View.

                        <b>4. ConstraintLayout :</b> It is the most recent type of layout which was introduced in android on
                        May 30, 2016. Previously for the more complex User Interfaces, mixture or different layouts e.g linear
                        and Relative layouts were used. But Constraint Layout is efficient enough to create complex UI hence
                        avoiding the complexities. It is the default layout in Android Studio.

                    <p>Let's understand some basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming to understand this code.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Object Oriented Programming:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is a type of programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but
                        also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. In this way,
                        the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers
                        can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics
                        from other objects.</p>
                    <p>One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming
                        techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when
                        a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of
                        its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Object:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>Objects are the basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system. Programming problem is analyzed
                        in terms of objects and nature of communication between them. When a program is executed, objects
                        interact with each other by sending messages. Different objects can also interact with each other
                        without knowing the details of their data or code.</p>
                    <p>An object is an instance of a class. A class must be instantiated into an object before it can be used
                        in the software. More than one instance of the same class can be in existence at any one time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Class:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>A class is a collection of objects of a similar type. Once a class is defined, any number of objects
                        can be created which belong to that class. A class is a blueprint, or prototype, that defines the
                        variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Instance:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>The instance is the actual object created at runtime. One can have an instance of a class or a particular
                        object.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>State:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>The set of values of the attributes of a particular object is called its state. The object consists of
                        state and the behaviour that's defined in the object's class.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Method:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>Method describes the object’s abilities. A Dog has the ability to bark. So bark() is one of the methods
                        of the Dog class.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Message Passing: </u>
                    </p>
                    <p>The process by which an object sends data to another object or asks the other object to invoke a method.
                        Message passing corresponds to "method calling".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Abstraction:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details
                        or explanations. Classes use the concept of abstraction and are defined as a list of abstract attributes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Encapsulation:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is the mechanism that binds together code and data in manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside
                        interference and misuse. In short, it isolates a particular code and data from all other codes and
                        data. A well-defined interface controls the access to that particular code and data. The act of placing
                        data and the operations that perform on that data in the same class. The class then becomes the 'capsule'
                        or container for the data and operations.</p>
                    <p>Storing data and functions in a single unit (class) is encapsulation. Data cannot be accessible to the
                        outside world and only those functions which are stored in the class can access it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Inheritance:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object. This supports the hierarchical
                        classification. Without the use of hierarchies, each object would need to define all its characteristics
                        explicitly. However, by use of inheritance, an object need only define those qualities that make
                        it unique within its class. It can inherit its general attributes from its parent. A new sub-class
                        inherits all of the attributes of all of its ancestors.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Polymorphism:</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>Polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form. An operation may exhibit different behaviours
                        in different instances. The behaviour depends on the data types used in the operation.</p>
                    <p>It is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action
                        is determined by the exact nature of the situation. In general, polymorphism means "one interface,
                        multiple methods", This means that it is possible to design a generic interface to a group of related
                        activities. This helps reduce complexity by allowing the same interface to be used to specify a general
                        class of action. It is the compiler's job to select the specific action (that is, method) as it applies
                        to each situation.</p>
                    <p>Remember that this Activity1.java is a backend file for activity_1.xml file. </p>

                        <li>
                            Defined a variable named 'button' of type 'Button' to hold values related to the button we used in UI. 'private' is an access
                            modifier which means this variable can only be used within this class.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            onCreate() is a method used to defines the actions to be taken when this activity is initiated. i.e. when this page is loaded.
                            It is protected to it can be used in the classes which inherites this class.

                        <li>
                            'Bundle savedInstanceState' : The savedInstanceState is a reference to a Bundle object that is passed into the onCreate method
                            of every Android Activity. Activities have the ability, under special circumstances, to restore
                            themselves to a previous state using the data stored in this bundle. If there is no available
                            instance data, the savedInstanceState will be null. For example, the savedInstanceState will
                            always be null the first time an Activity is started, but may be non-null if an Activity is destroyed
                            during rotation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            setContentView(R.layout.activity_1):
                            <p>R means Resource</p>
                            <p>layout means design</p>
                            <p>activity_1 is the xml you have created under res->layout->acitivity_1.xml</p>
                            <p>Whenever you want to change your current Look of an Activity or when you move from one Activity
                                to another . The other Activity must have a design to show . So we call this method in onCreate
                                and this is the second statement to set the design
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In next line the id of the button is assigned to the 'button' variable using 'findViewById()' method.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What should happen when user clicks that button ? to define that, 'setOnClickListener()' method is used. First we are creating
                            new object and then calling 'onClick()' method by passing that object. Here we are defining that
                            method named 'openActivity2()' should be called.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It can be used to launch another activity. So inside
                            openActivity2() method, object 'intent' of 'Intent' type is created and the Activity2 class is
                            passed as a value. Then 'intent' variable is passed to 'startActivity' method which is used to
                            start a new activity, in this case, Activity2.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now go to Activity2.java and write the following code in it. Refer the following image.

                        <u>Advantages of OOP:</u>

                            Object-Oriented Programming has the following advantages over conventional approaches.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract data types where implementation
                            details are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by
                            the programmer.
                        </li>
