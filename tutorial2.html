                    <img src="./images/tutorial2/pic1.png"> Fig 1: Version Control Workflow
                    <p>Version control helps a team to collaborate and work together without any hassles. For easier understanding
                        of version control workflow, we will use Git. Git helps in developing a project without any repetitions
                        of a work by various team members and in keeping every member of team up to date.
                    </p>
                    <p>The above sketch describes the overview of the workflow and some of the popular terms used during version
                        control. </p>
                    <p>Let’s start with our first project.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a GitHub account by signing up with your email address and a password.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once the account is created, this is how it’ll look.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic2.png">
                    <p>Fig 2: Screenshot of GitHub Account Page</p>
                    <p>You can see the list of repositories you have created as well as the repositories you are contributing/contributed
                        to on the left side.</p>
                    <ul>Now, let’s create an android project.
                        <li>Open Android Studio in your PC. Once you do this, a window as shown below will appear.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic3.png">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Since you are creating a new project from scratch, you will click on “Start a new Android Studio Project”. You will be prompted
                            to another screen where you’ll be asked to give the project name and company domain (a unique
                            name to identify as yours, you can just give your name here) as seen in the screenshot below.
                        </li>>

                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic4.png">
                    <p>
                        After you have given the name of your application, you’ll be given the option to choose the target devices.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic5.png">
                    <p>In this tutorial you will learn to develop a simple mobile application, so the targeted device you’ll
                        choose will be “Phone and Tablet” as shown in the screenshot above.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, you’ll be asked to choose an activity type for your application. The activity type is nothing but
                        a screen form for your application. Based on the application this activity form changes. For this
                        tutorial, you can select the “empty activity” form as shown in the screenshot.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic6.png">
                    <p>Next, you’ll be asked to give the above selected activity a name and a layout name. Android Studio already
                        gives a suggestion for the names, you can just use those.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic7.png">
                    <p>Once you click on “Next”, you’ll get a screen like this:</p>
                    <p>This screen shows that the project has been successfully created. Now click on “Finish”.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic8.png">
                    <p>The above window pops up. This window says that the entire setup required for the project is being built.</p>
                    <p>Once the built is done, you’ll see a screen like above. Both a jar file and an XML file are created for
                        the activity.</p>
                    <p>Now, you will push (When you update the existing project in the repo with the changes you made locally,
                        that is, you are trying to make some changes to the project.) this project into your earlier created
                        Git account.</p>
                    <p>First you are to sign in to your Git account.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic9.png">
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic11.png">
                    <p>Now, click on “New Repository” and give a name to the repo (The database which contains all the files
                        created).
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic12.png">
                    <p>After creating the repo, you’ll see a screen like the one shown below.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic14.png">
                    <p>The project is on your Git account. Now, you will be adding your team members as contributors for the
                        project.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the above shown window, click on “Settings” and then on “contributors” present in the left corner.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic13.png">

                    <p>You can give the names of your team members here and once they accept your invite to collaborate, you
                        will have a shared repo among each other.</p>
                    <p>Each team member after accepting the invite can clone the project onto their local system. The option
                        is available in green color on the right side in the below shown screenshot.</p>

                    <p>Once the team member has his/her copy on their local system, he/she can just open the project and make
                        any kind of changes.</p>
                    <p>And when the team member is sure of the changes he/she made, the member can merge (Incorporating the
                        changes made by you on your local file to the repo) their code into a branch other than the “master
                        branch” (created by the team leader).
                    </p>
                    <p>Before merging the code, one can make a “pull (When you get the last updated version of the project along
                        with the changes you made locally) request”, by clicking on “New Pull Request” seen on the below
                        screenshot.
                    </p>
                    <p>To check the differences between the branches before merging them, we go a head with pull requests. The
                        screen looks like this:</p>

                    <img src="images/tutorial2/pic15.png">
                    <p>Now, a team member can compare the changes and see the differences and then merge their code.</p>
